======= install atom shell commands from Atom application =======
TRY THIS METHOD FIRST
• open atom (if it's not already open)
• select Atom > Install Shell Commands from the menu
• Atom will install commands to enable command line launch
  (note: you may need to quit atom and restart)
• test the installation by opening a project in atom:
    - navigate to project folder
    - enter this command (the period means "open everything in file"):
        $ atom .
    - you can also open specific files/folders:
        $ atom <filename>
        $ atom <foldername>


======= install atom shell commands from command line =======
TRY THIS IS METHOD 1 FAILS
• navigate to top user level
    $ cd ~

• navigate two levels up from there (may be one or three levels... go to highest available)
    $ cd ..
    $ cd ..
    $ cd ..

• list files/directories at that level
    $ ls
        <many files>

• look for usr directory and navigate to it
    $ cd usr

• look for local directory and navigate to it
    $ cd local

• look for bin directory and navigate to it
    $ cd bin

• look for an atom file in the bin directory
    $ ls
        Magick++-config				import
        apm					        linkicc
        applygeo				    listen
        atom					    listgeo
        autoconf				    lprsetup.sh

• if you don't see atom, copy and paste this line into the command line:
    $ ln -s /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/atom.sh /usr/local/bin/atom
